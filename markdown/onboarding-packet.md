# Welcome to Your Apprenticeship!

We're excited to have you here. This packet contains information that past
apprentices have found helpful.

We recommend looking through it now and referring back to it later. Think of
this packet as your Hitchhiker's Guide during your apprenticeship. Don't Panic!

This packet is available at https://github.com/crmckenzie/apprenticeship.
Feel free to file a pull request to improve any aspect of it, no matter how tiny.

# The Plan

Your first four to six weeks are spent learning the tools, techniques, patterns, and practices that you will need to work on full-scale projects. You will have a dedicated mentor who's responsibility is to keep your learning moving forward at all times. There will be a lot of reading, practice, and working on tutorials.

At the end of this period you will be given a project to work on. You will be expected to write code of the same quality as our most Senior developers. Your mentor's job will be to help you achieve that.

At the end of your internship we will be prepared to either make you an offer or tell you there isn't a good spot for you. Our decision about whether to bring you on as an employee depends on several factors including: 

* your performance
* your availability 
* your interest in working for us, and 
* an open position

Don't worry! We will do everything we can to make your time here as amazing
as we can and prepare you for your step after the apprenticeship.

## Your mentor

Your mentor's name is:                      .  This person is your guide through the program. S/he will push you to learn as much as you possibly can in a very short period of time. Everything you learn will be required for you to perform project-work effectively in a collaborative team-environment. Although there is a lot of material to learn, there is little to no extraneous information. Most of what you learn you will take with you into your career and apply regardless of the kind of software you work on, OS, programming language, or tool stack.

## Your Coach

Your coach's name is:                       . This person will stay in touch with you about how your program is going. His/her job is to ensure that the program is working for you and to coach your mentor about any changes that may need to be made to accommodate your needs or any issues that may arise. This person will also pair with you from time to time.

## How am I doing?

You will meet with your Coach once a week to talk through your
progress.

Your Mentor will work with you to create a Trello board to track your learning and other [goals](apprentice-goals.md).

## Self-guided learning

Whenever appropriate or applicable to your work, you should take time away from
work to do some self-guided learning. This can include reading material
from books, attending workshops, or learning about and trying out a technique
or library.

# Getting the Most Out of apprentice.io

## Expectations

Your apprenticeship is an opportunity. The more you put into it, the more you
will get out of it.

There is some structure to guide you through the program and also people
available to help you along the way, but the engine of this experience is your
effort. Learning should take up some of your evening/weekend time.

You should expect this to be a mentally intense period of your life where you
are learning a great deal. Hard work pays off.

## Breakable Toy

A Breakable Toy (http://redsquirrel.com/dave/work/a2j/patterns/BreakableToys.html)
is a side project you are excited/passionate about.

This project should be an anchor to your learning, allowing you to raise new
questions and a place to apply new skills/techniques. To get the most out of it,
you should put the code in Github and give your mentors and apprentice cohort
access to the project. You should also deploy it to Heroku.

There is no expectation for other apprentices to contribute to your project, but
everyone should have access and input is welcome.

## Feedback

It's not easy, but you should get comfortable asking for and receiving feedback.
People are nice and none of it is personal. It's a great way to develop
professionally.

# Tools and Weapons

## Workstation setup

Your mentor will help you get your workstation set up. 

In addition to your developer tools you will need access to some internal web sites.

* [teamcity](http://teamcity.paraport.com) - log in using your Windows credentials.
* [leankit](http://parametric.leankit.com) - used to track project work
* [confluence](https://parametric.atlassian.net/wiki/dashboard.action;jsessionid=C3D9F5C94F999A870838AAA696427D7B) - internal wiki which provides information on projects and processes

## Friday Lunches

Developers often go to lunch together on Fridays. This is a great opportunity to talk with other members of the team.

# Improve the Apprenticeship Program

We encourage you to propose changes to the apprentice process, including hiring,
onboarding, and anything else that you think could be better. Everyone is constantly trying to do a better job and we welcome feedback.

As an apprentice, you have much better insight into what could make the process
better for you than does someone who's been working here for five years. Feedback is always, always appreciated on everything.
